## Getting Started

#### First clone the repository from github

```bash
# HTTPS
${{env.REPOSITORY_GITHUB_URL}}.git
```

```bash
# SSH
git@github.com:${{env.REPOSITORY_FULL_NAME}}.git
```

```bash
# GITHUB CLI
gh repo clone ${{env.REPOSITORY_FULL_NAME}}
```

#### Or fork this project clicking in the fork button set in head of this page.

If you need help for this step check the next guide:
[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

#### Set node version with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#node-version-manager---) and install dependencies

```
nvm use
npm install
```

#### Finally you can start a local dev server with this command

```
npm start
```

#### Also exists a command for apply code writing rules like indents, semicolons, etc. You can use the following command

```
npm run pretty
```

## Contributing

#### To contribute to the project you need to create a new branch from the main branch

```git
git checkout -b my-new-branch
```

#### Once you complete your project changes can be committed following the standard established by [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Examples

#### Commit message with no body

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

#### Commit message with scope

```
feat(lang): add Polish language
```

#### Commit message with description and breaking change footer

```
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

If the code passes the tests and the commit message follows the standards set by [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), you can commit your changes and upload them to the remote repository and you're ready to **create a Pull Request** to the **main branch**.

If you need help to make a pull request, you can consult the following link:

[https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)

### Linters, Code Formater and other tools

All changes to the project will be validated by creating a commit. These are the tools used to ensure that all code follows the quality standards defined for all contributions:

- [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)
- [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)
- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
- [Lint Staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)

## Releases

To create a release it is necessary to prepare the project following these steps

#### Create a new version with tag

```
npm version <version>
```

The above command receives as a parameter a specific version such as 1.4.0 or a version type defined by npm's [semantic versioning](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning) which will automatically increment the number.

These are the available types that can be used as a parameter:

- **Patch** releases: `1.0` or `1.0.x` or `~1.0.4`
- **Minor** releases: `1` or `1.x` or `^1.0.4`
- **Major** releases: `*` or `x`

### Examples

```
npm version 1.4.0
```

```
npm version minor
```

#### Upload the tag to the remote repository

```
git push origin <tag>
```
